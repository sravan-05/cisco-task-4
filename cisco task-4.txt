Tools
AsyncAPI: A specification for describing event-driven architectures like WebSocket. You can use it to describe WebSocket-based APIs just as you would describe REST APIs with the OpenAPI specification. Learn why you should consider using AsyncAPI with WebSocket and how to do so.
HumbleNet: A cross-platform networking library that works in the browser. It consists of a C wrapper around WebSockets and WebRTC that abstracts away cross-browser differences, facilitating the creation of multi-user networking functionality for games and other apps.
ÂµWebSockets: Highly scalable WebSocket server and client implementation for C++11 and Node.js.
Socket.IO: A long polling/WebSocket based third party transfer protocol for Node.js.
SocketCluster: A pub/sub WebSocket framework for Node.js with a focus on scalability.
WebSocket-Node: A WebSocket server API implementation for Node.js.
Total.js: Web application framework for Node.js (Example: WebSocket chat)
Faye: A WebSocket (two-ways connections) and EventSource (one-way connections) for Node.js Server and Client.
SignalR: SignalR will use WebSockets under the covers when it's available, and gracefully fallback to other techniques and technologies when it isn't, while your application code stays the same.
Caddy: A web server capable of proxying arbitrary commands (stdin/stdout) as a websocket.
ws: a popular WebSocket client & server library for Node.js.
jsonrpc-bidirectional: Asynchronous RPC which, on a single connection, may have functions exported on the server and, and the same time, on the client (client may call server, server may also call client).
cowboy: Cowboy is a small, fast and modern HTTP server for Erlang/OTP with WebSocket support.
WebSocket King: A client tool to help develop, test and work with WebSocket servers.
PHP WebSocket Server: Server written in PHP to handle connections via websockets wss:// or ws://and normal sockets over ssl:// ,tcp://
Channels: Django library that adds support for WebSockets (and other protocols that require long running asynchronous connections).
Flask-SocketIO: gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server.
Gorilla WebSocket: Gorilla WebSocket is a Go implementation of the WebSocket protocol.
